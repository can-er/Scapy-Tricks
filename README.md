# Scapy-Tricks

Scapy is a tool that allows you to forge your own packets through a network. 
These short programs provide an introduction to network protocols described in the RFC's.

> A basic understanding of the OSI model is required to build your first own packets. 

Once you're comfortable with the Internet fundamentals, enjoy it ! :)
